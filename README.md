# Fiverr Spam Count Chrome Extension
A Google Chrome extension developed by Tufayel Ahmed for Fiverr Spam Count that helps to see incoming spam messages right beside the "Dashboard" of the Fiverr website. Also, it shows the unread message count beside the website title in the browser tab. This is very helpful for answering messages that go to spam but are potential projects that you might miss if you didn't manually check.

# How reliable it has been?
I have been personally using this for over 2 years already and it's been a very helpful one.
